		<div class="card-body"> In our world today, discrimination against people of color continue to get out of hand. People do not
								get the same opportunities and get treated unreasonably because of their race. For centuries, this has been
								leading to several devastating issues. Despite these events, people from today still do not take this as a
								serious matter. How far are people willing to go before realizing how big of a mess this is causing?</div>
								
		<div class="card-body"> White people are more likely to get better opportunities compared to Black people. According to									
								research, white patients in the US receive better quality health care. From 2013 to 2017, they have been
								getting better treatment than about 34% of Hispanic patients, 40% of Black patients, and 40% of Native
								American patients. It was also found that job applicants with white-sounding names are 50 percent more
								likely to be called back than those with black-sounding names. They will even get a salary of about 25% more
								than their black counterparts.div></div>	
								
		<div class="card-body"> Black people, on the other hand, has experienced several injustices because 
								of their skin color. On average, Black men are sentenced 19.1% longer than those White men who were also convicted
								for the same crimes. They are also 6 times more likely to be arrested for the use of drugs, even if the Whites use it									
								at a similar rate. In addition, several lives were already lost just because of their skin color. Due to racial
								violence, at least 96 people have already been killed. One of the most recent is George Floyd’s death, which
								gave rise to the Black Lives Matter movement once again.</div>
								
		<div class="card-body"> With that said, we can infer that the Black people faced a lot of unjust treatments mainly because of the White people. 
								I propose that the White people be put to death. With them gone, the Black people will not be treated any less compared
								to anyone. No one will be more privileged than the others. The remaining will all have the same opportunities in education, 
								workplace, healthcare, etc. In addition, the rates of injustices due to color will drop. This will spare the innocent 
								lives that the White people were threatening.</div>
								
		<div class="card-body"> Racial  discrimination has already cost a lot of lives. People are being robbed of opportunities just because of their skin 
								color. They don’t even get to express and be themselves freely. Not only that, but they are also harmed for crimes they don’t 
								know or do. Because of this unfair treatment,people have started to protest against the system just for their voices to be heard.
								I personally do not have the intention of executing this proposal, but only to let people know how harmonious the world will be 
								without racial discrimination.</div>
